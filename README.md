# R4Z0R-TUBE 

### This is my biggest release so far, I've been working on this Youtube Downloader for quite a while now, learning a lot along the way, and some libraries from others I've used! Among other things, my program uses the following things!

- https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode
- https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeDownloader
- https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html

## How To Use

Download the Release .rar file, and put it wherever you want. Just unpack it, and go into the the /DEBUG or the /RELEASE Folder, and start the
R4Z0R-TUBE.exe in there! Copy any video Link from Youtube, or a playlist, choose your Save File Path and download it! 

So my tool is using there API! So please take a look at them while using my program! 

# IMPORTANT NOTE: FFMPEG is required to use this tool!
>FFMPEG is inside of the DEBUG/RELEASE FOLDER! So the tool should work fine, if there is any problems, make sure you have FFMPEG inside the ROOT Folder where you also find the EXE of this project! 

Currently you can do the following things with this tool:

- [x] Download Single Videos as MP3 Files!
- [x] Download whole Playlists and Queue them as MP3 Files! 
- [x] Progress Bar that shows you how many Videos you have downloaded and the current %!

Coming Soon:

- [ ] Better Design
- [ ] Different Quality Settings
- [ ] Video Support
